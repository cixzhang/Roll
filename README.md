Roll
====

Roll is a Chrome extension that lets you roll any-sided dice in Chrome's Omnibox (address bar) using dice notation. For example, if you want to roll 2 6-sided dice, you would type "roll 2d6" into the omnibox and press enter. Roll can roll multiple dice with multiple sides and can perform basic addition and subtraction after the dice rolls.
